# Yelloskin Reborn osu!

The old version of my skin is available on the [`legacy` branch](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy).

This version started over again using Blobs as the base.

## Old version and other skinning stuff

- [Yelloskin](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy) - the original skin
- [(no) Nekopara](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy/extras/(no)%20Nekopara) - the Nekopara skin but gameplay only
- [Lifelife Arista - Fixed Hitcircles](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy/extras/Lifeline%20Arista%20-%20Fixed%20Hitcircles) - Lifeline Arista's circles but correctly sized to fit the sliders properly.
- [Non Distracting Hitsound](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/legacy/extras/Non%20Distracting%20Hitsound) - My non distracting hitsounds
- [Distraction***Less***](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/distraction-less) - The Distraction***Less*** skins are designed to remove as much unuseful stuff from osu! gameplay as possible.
