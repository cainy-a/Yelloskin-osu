# Distraction***Less*** for osu!

Note: the Distraction***Less***<u><sup>Lite</sup></u> variant is recommended for most players and can be found [here](https://github.com/cainy-a/Yelloskin-osu/tree/distraction-less/variants/Lite)

A no-distractions osu! skin based on Yelloskin. Hides all HUD elements during gameplay.

This is not a skin made by me, it is a combination of lots of different skins that I hacked together into one.

The build script(s) reqires 7-zip installed.

## Extra setup highly recommended

In your game settings, do the following:

1. Set "Score Meter Type" to "None" to hide the hit error meter
2. Hiding the progress pie chart is unfortunately not possible, so instead set "Progress Display" to "Bottom-Right". While it isn't fully gone, I find it to be the most minimal and least distracting progress meter type
3. This skin DOES have hit lighting, in case you wanted it, and I tried to not go over the top with the hit lighting I chose to include, however if you're going for the full no distractions look turn this off.
4. Enable "Ignore Beatmap Hitsounds" as this skin comes with hitsounds (well just one hitsound actually) designed to be as minimal as possible.
5. If you're comfortable doing so, turning "Show Spectators" off will hide them from the HUD.
6. If the leaderboard shows up ingame, hit `Tab` on your keyboard at the next break.

## Drawbacks

Due to the following drawbacks, this skin is recommended for gameplay only and not for browsing leaderboards etc.

- As previously mentioned, the progress meter cannot be fully removed.
- Removing the score and combo numbers makes the results screen blank.
- The title and artist of the song that is displayed at the beginning of a map is not controlled by a skin and cannot be removed.
- Removing the small rank images so they don't show ingame also hides ranks on the map select screen and leaderboards until you click on a leaderboard entry.
