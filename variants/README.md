# Distraction***Less*** variants

## What are these variants?

These are versions of Distraction***Less*** with "patches" applied. These patches are modifications.

## The patch folder => Mix and match!

If you like one particular change a variant has over the main skin, you can apply it yourself by simply copypasting it's contents into the Distraction***Less*** skin folder, replacing files if asked. As an example if I wanted small rank icons on the main skin I would go into `Lite/patch/small-rank-icons` and copypaste it's contents into the skin folder.
